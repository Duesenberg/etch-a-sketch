# etch-a-sketch

The goal of the project was to make a simple sketchpad.
You can change the canvas size, from 1x1 up to 64x64.
There are three tools:
    1.A pencil, for which you can select a color of choice;
    2.An eraser;
    3.Drawing random colors with each square you pass.
To draw/erase, hold down the left click and drag across the canvas. You can clear the whole canvas when you click "Clear".
